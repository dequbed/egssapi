## Historical note

This library used to be based on the work of Mikael Magnusson, but ended up
being completely rewritten with no shared code to speak of.
Due to that the main branch of this repository has an orphanaged history and is
licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.  The old code base can still be found in
the `historic` branch should one want to reference or compare it.
